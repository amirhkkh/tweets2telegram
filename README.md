Tweets2Telegram
===
A simple Node.js/Express/MongoDB app to broadcast best tweets written in a specific language on telegram.  
This app makes use of `cld` for language detection since Twitter’s language detection is not
trustable and is based on “Best Effort”.

This is based on [top-tweets](https://github.com/sallar/top-tweets).  

## Dependencies
* NodeJS 
* MongoDB
* PM2 (from npm)
* Mocha (from npm)
* node-telegram-bot-api (from npm)
* Twitter Dev Credentials

## Install
### Install dependecies:
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g pm2
$ sudo npm install -g mocha
$ npm install
```

### Modify Config
Modify config file in `source/app/config.js` and add your Telegram and Twitter credentials. 

NOTE : Don't forget to make the bot administrator of the channel.

### Add Data Files
Add to files to data directory: `strings.json` and `users.json` both based on this structure:
```json
{
    "banned": [
        "someUser",
        "someOtherEvilUser",
        "..."
    ]
}
```
Items in `strings.json` file are only matched in tweet text, but items in `users.json` file are 
matched both in tweet text and user’s screen name. (Dont include `@` in screen names).

```bash
$ cd source/
$ pm2 start search
```
